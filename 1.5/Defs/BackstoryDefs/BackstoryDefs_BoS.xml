        <description>[PAWN_nameDef] was tasked by [PAWN_possessive] chapter to requisition materials, they weren’t capable or willing to produce themselves. [PAWN_pronoun] was advised to treat outsiders fairly and barter with them for the goods the Brotherhood desired. If they proved to be uncooperative however, [PAWN_pronoun] was allowed to confiscate wares the chapter needed. This made many wastelanders somewhat wary of [PAWN_objective].</description>

Since they thought of themselves as the only hope for the continued survival of humankind, their goal was to establish a strong presence within their domain to ensure that the common people of the wasteland obeyed their laws.</description>

        <description>As a child, [PAWN_nameDef] was a well-known troublemaker in the Brotherhood. [PAWN_pronoun] wasn’t devious, just a bit unruly. However, that was enough to ensure [PAWN_pronoun] spent a lot of time cleaning latrines, peeling tatos and other unpleasant tasks [PAWN_pronoun] was sentenced to by the elders.</description>

        <description>[PAWN_nameDef] took the scribes lessons about the impurity of the ghoul, the supermutant and the other mutated abominations to heart.

        <description>[PAWN_nameDef] always had an interest in the history of mankind, much to the irritation of [PAWN_possessive] teachers, as the Brotherhood had a very pragmatic mentality and preferred to teach their younglings more “useful” things. [PAWN_pronoun] wasn’t satisfied with the knowledge of how things are, but wanted to know how they came to be, not only in regard of the Brotherhoods own history. The rise and eventual fall of humanity was what fascinated [PAWN_nameDef] and [PAWN_pronoun] often procured this knowledge through unconventional means.</description>
